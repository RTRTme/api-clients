	Windows users:  Instructions for running PHP script in Windows

		First, you'll need to get PHP.  There are a couple installer projects out as seen in this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVYprZJ17k4, but those are kind of overkill since all you need is php cmd line client.

		I just did this:

		1) Download http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.4.22-Win32-VC9-x86.zip
		2) Extracted into c:\PHP
		3) Then, I put the csv-rtrt.php script c:\RTRT
		4) From CMD prompt, you should be able to run the script like this.

		cd c:\RTRT

		c:\RTRT> c:\PHP\php.exe c:\RTRT\script_name.php [params]
